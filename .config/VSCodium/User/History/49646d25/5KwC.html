            Hi! welcome to my website:D
        </h3>

            <p>
                
                I am making this as a personal coding project and was inspired 
                by a video I saw on indie web development
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm a grade 10 student who likes computers, 
                working though programming problems and the art of note taking.
                I have always found a lot of meaning in other peoples websites like 
                this but ive intentionally deprived myself of things like this for 
                a while because I want it to be mine rather than simply an amalgamation of other 
                peoples' website ideas
