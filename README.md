# README

This is my personal nixos config, using hyprland, alacritty, rofi, librewolf and pywal16, it is mainly for note taking, web browsing and discord but also school work and learning linux things.
**I will attempt to keep the main branch stable (no promises tho) but the working branch can be considered unstable and very well may be completely nonfunctional**

a few of the configs are just modifications [tonybanters' hyprland-btw](https://github.com/tonybanters/hyprland-btw) configuration

this config is now flake based but only so I can use different types of packages (stable or unstable) for different individual packages instead of system wide



#### Things I'm using & why
- Hyprland (duh) its a good tiling wm and wayland compositor
- pywal16 because its super fuckin cool man
- Waybar because I liked it and understand how to use it
- alacritty because it works fast and foot had some artifacting
- rofi because I am learning how to make my own scripts for it
- VSCodium because its very themeable and easy for gui modification of things
- Librewolf because its very simple and reasonably secure (might switch to something else)
- Obsidian because idk honestly idk I dont even use their servers I should switch to something thats FOSS but whatever
